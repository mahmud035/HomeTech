            What is the standard turnaround time for getting samples?
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Body>
            We strive to meet your targeted request date for samples, and most
            times, samples are available from our inventories of sample stock.
            Turnaround time is measured in days for products that may not be in
            our sample stock program. In some isolated instances typically
            relevant to custom products designed for our customerâ€™s
            applications, special raw materials may need to be brought in for
            samples.
